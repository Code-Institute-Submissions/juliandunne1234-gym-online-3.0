Nowadays people have access to so much information and filtering this information can be quite time consuming. Online media platforms are great but sometimes you have to watch the entire video to decide if the content is actually what you want.<br><br>

Finding 1-2 hours a day to go to a gym is not possible or even appealing to everyone. Anyone that has an interest in physical activity, whether that is 10-30 minutes or longer, everyone should have immediate access to a workout plan that will suit their requirements. <br><br>

This gym concept is suitable for everyone. From the beginner doing their first pushup to the more advanced user. It can be done at home or in the park, all you need is the ground beneath your feet. Actual equipment is optional as there is always a substitute readily available.<br><br>
